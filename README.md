# Pneumonia Prediction Model using Deep Learning on Docker
    
## About
With this project, we intend to detect pneumonia early so that it can be dealt with in the early stages. By training a model using Deep Learning using the chest X-ray images of normal and pneumonia affected individuals, we aim to have a model which can accurately predict whether the patient whoâ€™s chest X-ray image is being fed to the model, has pneumonia or not. By doing so, we will be able to bring this process of early detection of pneumonia into regular health checkups, thereby decreasing the number of undetected pneumonia cases, and thereby reducing the number of fatalities caused by undetected pneumonia. This system is then made reproducible and highly available using Docker.
